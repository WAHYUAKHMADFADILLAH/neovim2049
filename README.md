Welcome to my personal Neovim setup! 🎉 This repository is home to my custom configuration for Neovim, designed to boost productivity and make coding more enjoyable. It's heavily customized with plugins, key mappings, and features tailored for my workflow as a software developer and Linux enthusiast.

## ✨ Features

- **Lightning-fast startup** ⏩: Optimized for speed with lazy loading of plugins.
- **Modern UI** 🌟: Beautiful colorschemes and sleek interface tweaks for better aesthetics.
- **LSP Integration** 🔧: Full support for LSP, autocompletion, and diagnostics via `nvim-lspconfig`.
- **Git Integration** 🛠️: Seamless Git experience with powerful plugins like `vim-fugitive` and `gitsigns`.
- **File Management** 📂: Fast file navigation with `telescope.nvim` and `nvim-tree`.
- **Statusline** ⚡: Customized statusline using `lualine.nvim` for better visibility and style.
- **Keybindings** ⌨️: Efficient key mappings to navigate, edit, and manage files faster.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up this Neovim configuration on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (v0.8.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A terminal emulator of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WAHYUAKHMADFADILLAH/neovim2049 ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. Install the plugins:
   Launch Neovim and run the following command:
   ```vim
   :PackerSync
   ```

3. Ensure your environment supports the required dependencies like Node.js, Python, or Ruby for language server protocol (LSP) functionalities.

### Plugin Manager

This configuration uses [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for managing plugins. To install or update any plugin, simply run:

```vim
:PackerSync
```

## 🛠️ Key Plugins

Here are some of the key plugins that power this setup:

- **[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)**: Better syntax highlighting and parsing.
- **[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)**: Fuzzy finder for file navigation and searching.
- **[lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)**: A fast and customizable statusline.
- **[gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)**: Git integration for showing changes in the gutter.
- **[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)**: Easy setup for language servers.

For a complete list of plugins, check out the `plugins.lua` file.

## 🧑‍💻 Custom Key Mappings

To enhance productivity, I have set up some custom key mappings. Below are a few of my favorites:

- **File Navigation**: `Ctrl+p` for fuzzy file search.
- **Buffer Management**: `Ctrl+Tab` to cycle through buffers.
- **Code Navigation**: `gd` to go to definition, `gr` to find references.
- **Window Management**: `Ctrl+w` to navigate between windows.

Feel free to modify them to fit your workflow!

## 🎨 Themes and Appearance

I'm using the `gruvbox` colorscheme with a few tweaks to suit my personal taste. If you'd like to change the theme, simply update the `colorscheme` option in `init.lua` with your favorite one.
